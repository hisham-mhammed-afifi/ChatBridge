# ChatBridge

**ChatBridge** is a real-time customer support platform that allows seamless communication between customers and support agents. Built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO, it enables instant messaging between users through a WebSocket-based interface, making customer support fast, efficient, and scalable.

## Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Enables quick and responsive communication between agents and customers using WebSocket technology.
- **Agent & Customer Interfaces**: Provides separate, user-friendly interfaces for agents and customers to join the chat.
- **Persistent Chat Data**: Uses MongoDB to store chat history, customer details, and agent information.
- **Scalable and Modular Architecture**: A clean code structure with separate controllers, services, and WebSocket handlers for easy maintenance and scalability.
- **Agent Dashboard**: Allows agents to see a list of active customers and engage in individual chat sessions.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Socket.IO
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Database**: MongoDB (using Mongoose for ODM)
